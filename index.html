                    I am Naid Ibarra, a fledgling developer with a bachelor of science in computer science.
                    I'm most familar with programming in C and C++, but I have dabbled in python, C#, and even blueprints in Unreal Engine.
                    I also made this website, so you can include html and css in that list.
                    I have been involved in a number of programming projects, some by myself and others with a group.
                    More information on these projects can be found in the projects page of this site.
                    Right now I am seeking a junior developer position so that I may expand my professional experience.
