                    I worked with a group of four others to make a game in around ten weeks.
                    It is a horror game about surviving a zombie apocalypse in a customizable vehicle.
                    I was responsible for making the map, some UI, pickups, and the boss.
                    Although in a playable state, no build was made public.
                    Our repository, however, is public and can be found <a href="https://github.com/jt7williams/DaDangGang_Project">here</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was the first time I worked on a game with a team, and I learned a lot from it.
                    Each member had unique skills to bring to the project, and being in charge of the map instilled in me an affinity for level design.
                    We learned how to use git with a large file system since the assets like models and map files are much larger than code files.
                    We used agile methodology and a scrum framework to prioritize the most important aspects of the game first.
                    This was during covid, so our scrum meetings were in voice calls and we worked remotely.
                    Despite this, we were still able to collaborate effectively and make the majority of the planned features of our game.
                    It didn’t match our vision in the very beginning, but that was expected because we got a better idea of what we really wanted as we worked on it.
                    Overall I am happy with this project and am glad I got to work with a great group of people.

                <h2>Custom Maps via Modding an Unreal Engine Game</h2>
                <p>
                    This is a mod of one of my favorite games, Light Bearers.
                    If you are unfamiliar, it is an asymmetric game that plays like tag.
                    One player, the shadow, is tasked to tag the rest of the players, the light bears.
                    For more information on the game check it out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/765710/Light_Bearers/">steam</a>.
                    (Note: I am not affiliated with the game, I just modded it)
                    I used a pak file patch to replace unused map files with my own maps.
                    You can find the mod <a href="https://github.com/FireNoobsta/ModForLightBearers">here</a>.
                    These maps are my own, but use models and textures from the base game (which are not mine).
                    Right now there are 5 custom maps, and I will likely add more in the future.
                </p>

                    <img src="images/ExperimentalMap.png" alt="Thumbnail of experimental map" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    This is not a traditional map.
                    This is just a test map as I learned the mapping tools in unreal engine.
                    I also used it to learn the limitations of what I could and could not mod into an existing game.
                    Eventually, it became a map to find the limits of the movement system through obstacle courses.
                </p>

                <h3>Tropical Map</h3>
                <div class="image">
                    <img src="images/TropicalMap.png" alt="Thumbnail of tropical map" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    This was my first proper map.
                    It originally had a mountain in the center and was much larger.
                    After playing it I found it too large and eventually reworked it entirely.
                    It has a mechanic where a button can be pressed to extend a bridge across a gap, but it can toggled off again.
                </p>

                <h3>Panopticon Map</h3>
                <div class="image">
                    <img src="images/PanopticonMap.gif" alt="View of spotlights rotating around top floor" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    This map is based around a central panopticon.
                    It is designed like a prison and thus there are not a lot of places to hide.
                    There is also a “lockdown” button that when pressed spawns many walls that are only solid to light bears, so the shadow is unimpeded.
                    This button can be pressed again though to undo the lockdown.
                    This all seemed shadow sided to me so I made it so that bears do not take a fall penalty on this particular map.
                </p>

                <h3>Randomizer Map</h3>
                <div class="image">
                    <img src="images/RandomizerMap.png" alt="Comparison of two different permutations of randomizer map" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    This map was inspired by procedural level generators I find in many roguelikes I play.
                    Although mine is much simpler, I made it from scratch.
                    This map has a central island surrounded by 8 others that are randomly selected from a pool of 16 possible.
                    These are also given a random rotation, so they are designed to be approachable by at least 2 angles.
                    There are 12,870 ways to choose 8 options from 16, so this simple generation provides lots of different permutations even if you disregard the different rotations the islands can be.
                </p>

                <h3>Collectathon Map</h3>
                <div class="image">
                    <img src="images/RiverMap.gif" alt="Timelapse of map through day/night cycle" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    This map is different from others as it is not intended to be played traditionally.
                    This map is meant to be a collectathon where you explore a large map and try to find every collectible.
                    It is still under construction because of this massive size.
                    I made a day/night cycle for this map to emphasize the time it takes to traverse.

                    Modding an unreal game gave me a better understanding about how the engine works.
                    I found out which files rely on other files, and which can be replaced or deleted without breaking the game.
                    I also became much more familiar with the mapping tools provided by the engine.

                <h2>Ray Tracer</h2>

                    <img src="images/teapot.png" alt="Render of Utah Teapot" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    I wrote a program in C++ to render a scene using ray tracing.
                    I was provided starting code to parse input and output a png, but the ray casting and shaders I made myself.
                    I didn’t implement any optimizations to see how long it takes to render.
                    It can render spheres and a small number of triangles quickly.
                    However, the teapot pictured to the right consists of 6,320 triangles and took over an hour to render.
                    It makes me appreciate the advancements in ray tracing technology today.

                <h2>Farming Game</h2>
                <div class="image">
                    <iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tZQg2kU35aM" title="UCR EE/CS 120B Spring 2019 Naid Ibarra LED Farming" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>
                <p>
                    I used an ATMega 1284 microcontroller to program a simple farming game.
                    The code and a more thorough report can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Gh8oZz0nSyZNTB7B5A5w5M4yx-Fz3uWp">here</a>.
                    You interface with the game with a joystick and button.
                    An LCD screen displays the menu where you can buy seeds and plant them.
                    Your plot of land is represented by 16 leds that glow brighter as your crops grow.
                    You harvest and sell these plants to buy more seeds and repeat.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I used multiple state machines to implement this.
                    I learned a lot about handling raw input to make the menu navigation feel responsive.
                    Wiring the system was a challenge, but fortunately I used a large enclosure so I had plenty of room.

                    <img src="images/TraceBack.png" alt="Screenshot of puzzle solver output" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    I wrote a program that solves those sliding puzzles with 8 tiles in a 3x3 grid.
                    It can be found <a href="https://github.com/FireNoobsta/CS170Project1-EightPuzzle">here</a>.
                    It uses the A* algorithm with a variety of heuristics to search through the problem space.
                    Of the heuristics used, the Manhattan distance of each tile to its proper position proved to be the best heuristic to quickly solve the puzzle and with minimal memory usage.
                    Uniform cost search was understandably the worst since it is essentially a breadth first search of the problem space.
                    I calculated the branching factor to be 2.67 and testing on random puzzles confirmed that uniform cost search would explore around 2.67^d puzzle states (where d is the solution depth).
                    This project was an interesting endeavor in translating a real life puzzle into a representation that can be solved quickly by a program.
                    I still use what I learned from it to occasionally make simple programs to quench my own curiosity of certain problems.
                    For example, I made a similar program when I saw a rotating cylinder puzzle in a video game because I was curious about what configuration would be furthest from the solution.
